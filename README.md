# random-quotes-random-pics

First time creating a README.md for a project
uploaded to Github. Cheers! ðŸ¥³

This is a modification of the ZTM Monsters
Rolodex project - instead of a list of monsters,
I put together some random quotes along with 
some random pictures (hence the name ðŸ˜„).

The two APIs used were 
  Lorem Picsum - https://picsum.photos/
  Advice Slip API - https://api.adviceslip.com/
  
This project was created with Create React App.
